# Customer Churn Prediction

This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecom company and builds machine learning models to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service).

## Overview

The goal is to identify patterns and key features that influence churn, and to train classification models that can predict churn outcomes with reasonable accuracy.

## Dataset

- Telco Customer Churn dataset (Excel)
- Features include customer demographics, account details, services, and churn label.

## Project Workflow

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature encoding
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Interpretation of results

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn / Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/gayathrisatish13/customer-churn-prediction.git


2. Activate environment:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook churn_analysis.ipynb


## Future Improvements

- Add hyperparameter tuning
- Use cross-validation
- Deploy with Streamlit or Flask
