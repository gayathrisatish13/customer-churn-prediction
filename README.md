# customer-churn-prediction
End-to-end customer churn prediction project using Python and machine learning, including data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to identify patterns and build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to leave the company.

The goal is to help businesses reduce customer attrition by identifying high-risk customers early.

📊 Dataset

Dataset: Telco Customer Churn

📈 Results

Built a predictive model to classify churn vs non-churn customers.

Identified key factors influencing churn (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, tenure).

Evaluated model performance using classification metrics.
